      Contact the MMT administator Pekka MÃ¤kiaho at pekka.makiaho(at)uta.fi, who will send you a new password.<br /> 
      Remember to change the password after the first log in! For changing your password see <a accesskey="alt+4" href="#Q4">How can I change my password/edit my profile?</a></li>

      You can change your password and edit your profile by clicking the "Profile" link at the top right corner of MMT. Make the desired changes and click "Submit".<br />
      Ps. Your password is encrypted upon submitting it. That is why it seems to have a lot more characters on the screen than what you entered. Safe and sound!

	   <li>if your team logs the daily working time in MMT (see <a accesskey="alt+6" href="#Q6">

	   <li>click "Submit" once you are done, and your weekly report is saved</li>
        </ul>
